<h3>A browser based virtual fish tank.</h3>
Last Update: 10/19/2025

Food will idle up from the floor of the tank every few minutes. A new fish will join the tank for every 50 food that your primary fish eats. Open the options panel to name your fish and to customize your fish colors. Options are saved as a cookie letting you expand your tank over time. Don't want to wait for idle food... then you can actively feed your fish with the "F" key.
